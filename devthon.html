                <div class="about-content">Over the last fifty nine years, KSEBL has grown from a total installed capacity of 109 MW to an installed capacity of 2823 MW and created Transmission and Distribution networks. At present, the Board caters to the needs of over 1 crore  consumers spread over the urban and rural areas of the State. Its huge power station system and storage facilities are a sight to witness. The Board has recently begun the initiative to switch to the use of renewable energy in common households which will be a big game-changer for the State.
